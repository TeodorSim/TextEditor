# TextEditor
A program that transforms the terminal into a text editor.Itâ€™s about 1000 lines of C in a single file with no dependencies, and it implements all the basic features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.

The key-note of this program is that it uses the C++ under linux. The focus is to manipulate the terminal in such a way that all the safety features are not disturbing the user experience.
